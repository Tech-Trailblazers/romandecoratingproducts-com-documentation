## 📘 What Are SDS and MSDS?

- **SDS (Safety Data Sheet):** A standardized document that provides detailed information about a chemical product's properties, hazards, handling, storage, and emergency measures.
- **MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet):** An earlier format of the SDS, still valuable for reference and historical data.

These documents are essential for:

- 🧑‍🔬 Chemical safety and compliance training
- 🧠 Teaching machines to understand regulatory documentation
- 📊 Structuring data for NLP and information extraction

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This project was created to:

- 🧠 **Support educational initiatives** in chemistry, industrial safety, and regulatory studies
- 🤖 **Provide training data for AI/ML models**, especially in document understanding, classification, and summarization
- 📚 **Offer real-world documentation** for students, researchers, and developers to explore
